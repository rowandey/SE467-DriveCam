// recording_provider.dart
// Manages the full lifecycle of a recording session: start/stop, segment
// tracking, rolling-buffer eviction, and final file assembly via FFmpeg.
//
// Rolling-buffer design (from main branch):
//   Recording is split into segments when clips are saved, settings change,
//   or the periodic 5-minute flush timer fires. Each completed segment carries
//   a duration (seconds) and an estimated byte count (bitrate × duration ÷ 8).
//   After every addSegment call, _evictOldestIfNeeded drops the oldest
//   segment(s) from disk and the tracking list until both the time limit and
//   the storage limit from SettingsProvider are satisfied. The final saved
//   recording only contains the segments that survived eviction.
//
// Analytics (from KPI branch):
//   Recording start and stop events are tracked via AnalyticsController using
//   settings read directly from SettingsProvider rather than a cached snapshot,
//   since SettingsProvider is already injected for rolling-buffer eviction.
